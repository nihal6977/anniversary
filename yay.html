After that months passed i didnt spoke any single word regarding yes or no.THEN we came to NIGHTINGALE SCHOOL there also i was feeling uneasy to ask i was thinking that i might disturbe you.i thought if i will ask these shitty things to you then you might start hating me  and i dont want you to hate me.So i controlled my emotions and didnt asked you about it.I was happy seeing you enjoying with your friends i didnt dared to ask you cuz i didnt want to ruin your mood at that time.CHUPKE CHUPKE SE APKO dekhta tha class me bahar me har jagah(before our relation)Then i heared about you and SAM... when i heard about that i wasnt sure i thought my friends are just telling lie then one day i saw you with him then i knew that it was true.On that very day when i saw you two i was fully broken from inside i went home didnt ateanything went outside to roam around with MD AMAN to ease my heart.I didnt told him about these things i kept smile in my face and roamed around with him broken inside.Mann hudai thyo k garu k garu.Then when i came home i made my mind feel ease i told myself as i have promised myself"HER HAPPINESS IS MY HAPPINESS"with this quote in my mind i once again came to school on next day.In class i didnt told anybody about me.Every single day my life was going like tha slowly i was being cured by staring at you in class secretly without being caught in 4küòÅ1months passed like that i was slowly being healed but once accidently saw you talking with him at that my heart was crying but i was smiling.Jati heal bhathe tyati feri dekhi grnu prthyo.I just didnt focus in those things.You know at that time i wasnt havin courage to be around you i was feeling like i am just a piece of junk for you. BUT then one ay a cute,beautiful,sexy,hot girl named AAYUSTA gave me a letter expressing about how i misunderstood things then again i wrote the letter back but i didnt told you that i was knowing about you and sameer.Then one day indirectly you told"I LOVE YOU "to me through letter tyo dinn mero whole life ko best day thyo.
